# Network Packet Sniffer Application Architecture

## Backend (Packet Sniffing Logic)

### Language and Framework
- **C**: Ideal for performance and low-level network operations.
- **Libraries**: Use `libpcap` for capturing packets.

### Functionality
- Capture packets in real-time.
- Filter specific packet types.
- Analyze and parse packet data.
- Store packet information for frontend retrieval.

### Data Storage
- Temporary in-memory storage or SQLite for persistence.
- Efficient data structures for fast access.

## Frontend (Web UI)

### Technologies
- **Structure**: HTML/CSS.
- **Dynamics**: JavaScript, with React or Vue.js.

### Features
- Real-time packet data display.
- Filters for specific packet viewing.
- Statistical analysis tools (graphs, tables).

### Design Considerations
- Responsive design for various devices.
- User-friendly interface and navigation.

## Communication Between Backend and Frontend

### REST API
- Backend provides a RESTful API.
- Frontend uses HTTP requests to fetch data.
- JSON format for data exchange.

### WebSocket
- For real-time updates, use WebSockets.
- Backend pushes updates as packets are captured.

### Security
- Authentication for API access.
- Encrypted connections (HTTPS, WSS).

## Additional Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient backend data processing.
- Frontend optimizations for speed.

### Testing
- Unit tests for backend.
- Frontend UI and functionality tests.
- End-to-end testing of the complete application.

### Deployment Strategy
- Containerization (e.g., Docker).
- Cloud-based hosting solutions.

### Documentation
- Comprehensive API documentation.
- User manuals for the web interface.

### Security Best Practices
- Regular updates for libraries/frameworks.
- Robust error handling and logging.
