# Requirements 

* Network Packet Sniffer with a web-based UI*

## Requirement Analysis

### Define Objectives

Clearly define what you want your packet sniffer to achieve. Consider the features, performance requirements, and target audience.

### Research

Look into existing packet sniffers and identify what they offer and what they lack. This helps in understanding the market and potential niches.

## Design Phase

### Architecture Design
Decide on the overall architecture of your application. This includes how the backend (packet sniffing logic) will communicate with the frontend (web UI).

### UI/UX Design

Sketch the initial design of your web UI. Consider user experience, ease of use, and the data presentation.
Tool Selection:

### Programming Languages

You might use C or C++ for the backend for performance reasons. For the frontend, standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are suitable.
Libraries and Frameworks: Research and select appropriate libraries for packet capturing (like libpcap for C) and possibly frameworks for the web frontend (like React, Angular, or Vue.js).

## Environment Setup

### Development Environment

*Set up your development environment with the necessary compilers, code editors, and debugging tools.
Version Control: Initialize a repository (like Git) for version control.*

### Backend Development

Packet Capturing: Start by coding the basic functionality to capture network packets using a library like libpcap.
Packet Processing: Implement processing of captured packets to extract useful information.

### Frontend Development

### Web Interface: 

Develop the web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Focus on displaying the data received from the backend in a user-friendly manner.

### Interaction with Backend: 

Implement the logic for the frontend to interact with the backend, possibly using AJAX, WebSockets, or REST APIs.

## Integration

Combine Backend and Frontend: Ensure the frontend and backend work seamlessly together, displaying real-time data effectively.

### Testing

#### Unit Testing

Test individual components for correctness.

#### Integration Testing 

Test the integrated backend and frontend.

#### Performance Testing

Ensure the application performs well under expected loads.

## Documentation and Deployment

### Documentation

Write documentation covering how to install, use, and troubleshoot your tool.

### Deployment

Consider how you will deploy the tool, whether it's for local use or hosted online.

## Feedback and Iteration

### User Feedback

After an initial version is ready, gather feedback from potential users.

### Iterative Improvement

Continuously improve the application based on user feedback and your own observations.

> Remember, this is a complex project that requires a good understanding of both network protocols and web development. It's normal to face challenges and require iterative improvements over time.
